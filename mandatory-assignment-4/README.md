# Mutual Exclusion 
Welcome to DisGo's Mutual Exclusion Program! This README-file is here to provide you help when running the program, and starting your preferred number of processes up.
Please follow the guide step by step to run it smoothly.

## Guide to run the program
To run the program, first you have to make sure you're in the right folder: 'mandatory-assignment-4'. When that has been settled, do as follows:
1. Run the program: `go run main/main.go`.
2. When prompted, choose the number of processes to initialize by typing your preffered number.

And that's it! Now the program should be running.

## Additional notes on the program
To end the program, simply close the program, or press `ctrl` + `C`.
